            Repo: boolean-uk-js-naive-password-generator Description To practice
            today's concepts, we're going to create a naive password generator!
            We want you to grab the user's input, and then output a password for
            them. Since we're still learning here, the passwords won't be super
            secure... Instructions - get the user's first name - get the user's
            last name - get the user's favourite colour - tell the user their
            new password: - the password must have the following format: first
            name + last name + favourite colour + 42 Tips - You can manipulate
            strings in many different ways, make sure to google about it if
            you're not sure Challenge Instead of 42, can you make your passwords
            more secure and generate a random number between 0 and 200? Use your
            Google-Fu skills! Challenge 2 Now that we can generate a random
            number, can you make it so that the user can input the range in
            between you generate the random number? See if you can find a way to
            parse the input so that you can have 2 numbers! Again, Google is
            your friend...
